# NASA-POTD

User selects a date from the menu and a picture of the day from NASA is displayed along with up to ten near field Earth objects for the day (displayed closest to fartheset from Earth).

Future development is encouraged as the site NASA gives you is pretty atrocious. This is just a start to what I'd like the final project to be. Any questions feel free to ask.
